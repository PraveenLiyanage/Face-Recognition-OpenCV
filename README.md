# Face Recognition with OpenCV

## Overview

Welcome to the Face Recognition with OpenCV project! This application showcases the power of computer vision by recognizing faces in real-time using OpenCV. The project uses a combination of Haarcascades for face detection and a simple recognition algorithm.

## Features

- Real-time face recognition using your computer's camera.
- Pre-trained Haarcascades for accurate face detection.
- Simple and extensible recognition algorithm.
- Easy-to-use and well-documented code.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/praveenliyanage/Face-Recognition-OpenCV.git

## Navigate to the project directory:

- cd Face-Recognition-OpenCV

## Install the required dependencies:

- pip install -r requirements.txt
